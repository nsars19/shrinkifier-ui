This is a user interface for an application that compresses image files. It sends the images to an Express app that handles the processing. The Express app was initially a node app I built to process large batches of images used in my other projects. The initial project that this was based upon can be found [here](https://github.com/nsars19/image-compressor), and the Express app can be found [here](https://github.com/nsars19/shrinkifier-api).
